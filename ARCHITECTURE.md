# Architecture

peer-review-mcp follows the flattened Clean Architecture of its reference project (`gemini-for-claude-mcp`): a provider-agnostic domain core, infrastructure adapters at the edges, manual dependency injection in the composition root, and `neverthrow` `Result` values instead of thrown exceptions on every fallible path.

## Layout and dependency flow

```
src/
  domain/            # pure core — no vendor names, no I/O, no SDKs
    entities/        # PeerRequest, PeerResponse, TokenCountResult, QuorumResult
    ports/           # IPeerClient (the single LLM port), PeerSource
    errors/          # PeerApiError, PeerRateLimitError (+ re-exported shared errors)
    use-cases/       # PeerReviewQuorumUseCase, agreement module, QueryPeer/ListPeers/CountTokens
  infrastructure/
    adapters/        # OpenAiCompatAdapter, AnthropicCompatAdapter, CredentialProvider, shared HTTP
    controllers/     # Zod-parse input → use-case → {success,data|error} envelope
    schemas/         # strict Zod input schemas for the MCP boundary
    mcp/             # stdio server, tool registry, tool definitions
  config/            # config-file (Zod) + env loading, fail-fast validation
  shared/            # DomainError base + common errors, pino logger (stderr), envelope helpers
  app.ts             # composition root: config → credential providers → adapters → use-cases → tools
```

Rules:

- **`domain/` never imports from `infrastructure/` or `config/`.** It sees outside LLMs only through `IPeerClient` and the `PeerSource` descriptor. `grep -riE 'openai|anthropic|gemini' src/domain/` returns zero hits — vendor identity lives in configuration, not code.
- **One port, two adapters.** `IPeerClient` (`complete`, `countTokens`) is implemented by the OpenAI-compatible adapter (`POST {baseUrl}/chat/completions`) and the Anthropic-compatible adapter (`POST {baseUrl}/v1/messages`). A factory binds a configured source's `apiType`, `baseUrl`, and `model` to an adapter instance. These two wire formats cover OpenAI, Gemini (AI Studio & Vertex OpenAI-compat endpoints), OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, Anthropic, and most gateways.
- **No vendor SDKs.** All outbound HTTP uses the Node 20+ global `fetch`.
- **Results, not exceptions.** Ports, use-cases, and controllers pass `Result<T, DomainError>`; only the MCP layer converts to the wire envelope. Handler throws are caught and returned as a generic `INTERNAL_ERROR`.
- **Validation at the boundary.** Strict Zod schemas parse tool input; `model`, `temperature`, and output limits are injected server-side from config and cannot be supplied by the client.
- **Credentials are indirection-only.** Each source authenticates via exactly one of `apiKeyEnv` (static key by env-var name) or `apiKeyCommand` (a command minting a short-lived bearer token, cached with a TTL). Credential values never appear in config, logs, errors, or responses. Resolution failure marks the source `unavailable`; it never crashes the server.

## The quorum algorithm

`peer_review` is orchestrated by `PeerReviewQuorumUseCase`:

1. **Target selection.** The caller may pass `tier` (highest tier to escalate to); default is the highest configured tier. `requiredWeight = thresholds[targetTier]`.
2. **Tiered parallel fan-out.** All tier-1 sources are called in parallel. Unavailable sources are itemized immediately (`status: "unavailable"`) and contribute nothing.
3. **Agreement evaluation.** The configured **arbiter** source receives the question and all successful responses as delimited data (never as instructions), at temperature 0, and must return strict JSON: a consensus answer plus a per-response agreement rating in [0, 1] (one re-ask on malformed JSON). A source *agrees* when its rating ≥ 0.7; only agreeing sources' weights count.
4. **Escalation.** If `agreeingWeight < requiredWeight`, the next tier fans out and agreement is re-evaluated over the **accumulated** response set. Repeat until quorum or tiers (≤ targetTier) are exhausted.
5. **Certainty.** `certaintyScore = min(1, agreeingWeight / requiredWeight) × meanAgreementOfAgreeingSources`. Failed/unavailable sources contribute 0 and are itemized — a degraded quorum is visible, never silent. An unmet quorum still returns `success: true` with `quorum.achieved: false`; the caller decides.

## Runtime guards

- **Global deadline** (`PEER_REVIEW_DEADLINE_MS`, default 240 s): on expiry, in-flight calls are aborted via `AbortController` and the accumulated partial result is returned — the MCP caller always gets a response, never a hang.
- **Early-abort on quorum:** once agreeing weight meets the threshold mid-tier, pending same-tier requests are aborted to save cost. Same-tick sibling responses are drained first so no completed answer is discarded.
- **Arbiter fallback:** if the arbiter fails (transport error, or malformed JSON after one re-ask), the response falls back to the highest-weighted successful source's answer with `certaintyScore: 0` and `quorum.arbiterFailed: true` — never a crashed request.
- **Arbiter hardening:** temperature 0, a rigid rubric system prompt, and peer responses wrapped in data delimiters (`<<<DOCUMENT n source="...">>>`) with explicit ignore-embedded-instructions rules, blunting cross-peer prompt injection. Per-source ratings are returned so an outlier hijack is inspectable.
- **Status-code error mapping:** adapters map errors from HTTP status only (429 → `PEER_RATE_LIMIT`, 404 → `PEER_API_ERROR` not-found, 401/403 → `CONFIGURATION_ERROR`, 5xx → `PEER_API_ERROR`), never from message text.
- **Retry with backoff:** 429/503/529 are retried with jittered exponential backoff (max 2 retries) inside the per-source timeout budget; a 401 invalidates the cached credential and retries exactly once with a re-minted token.
- **stdout hygiene:** the stdio transport owns stdout exclusively; pino logs to stderr (`destination: 2`). `console.log`/`process.stdout` do not appear in `src/`.

## Testing strategy

- **Domain tests** mock only the `IPeerClient` port (quorum escalation, early-abort, deadline partials, agreement semantics, certainty formula, arbiter fallback).
- **Adapter contract tests** pin request shapes and response parsing against recorded wire fixtures (success, 429, 5xx, malformed bodies) with an injected `fetch`, so wire-format drift fails loudly.
- **Controller tests** cover boundary validation (empty prompt, strict-schema rejection of `model`/`temperature`).
- **MCP tests** cover the envelope semantics (`TOOL_NOT_FOUND`, generic `INTERNAL_ERROR`, single text content block).
